Hi. My name is Mehdi Haghgoo. I started computer software education back in October 2008, and 
I have been in the industry back and forth, more or less so far. I became more active in the field
since 2016, when I started an Android development career.

You can communicate with me through issues (if you see an issue in the posts),
or you can use my profile Email address.
